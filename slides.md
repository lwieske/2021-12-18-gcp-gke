## Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)

* A simple way to automatically deploy, scale, and manage Kubernetes.

* Run Kubernetes on a platform built by the largest engineering contributor to
  K8s

* Start quickly with single-click clusters and scale up to 15000 nodes

* Leverage a high-availability control plane including multi-zonal and regional
  clusters
* Eliminate operational overhead with industry-first four-way auto scaling 
* Secure by default, including vulnerability scanning of container images and
  data encryption

---

## Speed Up App Development Without Sacrificing Security

* Develop a wide variety of apps with support for stateful, serverless, and
  application accelerators. Use Kubernetes-native CI/CD tooling to secure and
  speed up each stage of the build-and-deploy life cycle.

---

## Streamline Operations With Release Channels

* Choose the channel that fits your business needs. Rapid, regular, and stable
  release channels have different cadences of node upgrades and offer support
  levels aligned with the channel nature.

## Reduce Day 2 Ops With Help From Google SREs

* Get back time to focus on your applications with help from Google Site
  Reliability Engineers (SREs). Our SREs constantly monitor your cluster and its
  computing, networking, and storage resources.

## Two Modes Of Operation, One GKE

* GKE now offers two modes of operations: Standard and Autopilot. Standard is
  the experience we’ve been building since the launch of GKE, giving you full
  control over the nodes with the ability to fine tune and run custom
  administrative workloads. The all new Autopilot mode is a hands-off, fully
  managed solution that manages your entire cluster’s infrastructure without
  worrying about configuring and monitoring. And with per-pod billing, Autopilot
  ensures you pay only for your running pods, not system components, operating
  system overhead, or unallocated capacity.

## Pod And Cluster Autoscaling

* GKE is the industry’s first fully managed Kubernetes service that implements
  full Kubernetes API, 4-way autoscaling, release channels and multi-cluster
  support. Horizontal pod autoscaling can be based on CPU utilization or custom
  metrics. Cluster autoscaling works on a per-node-pool basis and vertical pod
  autoscaling continuously analyzes the CPU and memory usage of pods,
  automatically adjusting CPU and memory requests.

## Prebuilt Kubernetes Applications And Templates

* Get access to enterprise-ready containerized solutions with prebuilt
  deployment templates, featuring portability, simplified licensing, and
  consolidated billing. These are not just container images, but open source,
  Google-built, and commercial applications that increase developer
  productivity. Click to deploy on-premises or in third-party clouds from Google
  Cloud Marketplace.

## Container Native Networking And Security

* GKE Sandbox provides a second layer of defense between containerized workloads
  on GKE for enhanced workload security. GKE clusters natively support
  Kubernetes Network Policy to restrict traffic with pod-level firewall rules.
  Private clusters in GKE can be restricted to a private endpoint or a public
  endpoint that only certain address ranges can access.
